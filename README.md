# Customer-Survey-Analysis-using-Regression
Applying regression modeling on Customer Surveys.

**If you are looking to skim over the project without going into too much detail, you can always access it through [_here_](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mick-zhang/Customer-Survey-Analysis-using-Regression/blob/master/Customer%20Survey%20Github.ipynb?flush_cache=true).**

Customer survey has always been a very popular tool for retailers to determine the image of their brand, based on many different factors. These factors can include the perception of the company, the comprehension of the company, Customer's willingness to recommend the company, and etc. In order to productively improve the quality of survey results, companies can take advantage of different approaches for their call center, and measure the effectiveness of each approach based on customer behaviours and the associated cost. I will be attempting to implement regression analysis, for determining the effectiveness of each approach, that companies can implement to improve and protect their brand image.

The dataset I will be using is from a mock call center that emulates a real world customer survey.

I have also provided the direct link below if you wish to view the dataset I used to build my model:

This project was completed using Jupyter Notebook and Python with Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scipy, Statsmodels and Patsy.

This project was an interesting way to use Python for traditional statistical modeling. In the future, I will continue to apply other statistical models for data profiling.
